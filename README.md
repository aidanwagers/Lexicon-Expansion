# Lexicon-Expansion
This program utilizes a dataset of tweets that relate to vaping. It creates a list of tweets based on keywords and their presence or absence in tweets. As the program goes on, more words are added to the keyword list and two sets of tweets are created. The first set contains tweets containing at least one keyword. The second set of tweets contains tweets with none of the keywords. 

A function is then utilized to produce summary statistics and comparative statistics on the two sets of tweets.
